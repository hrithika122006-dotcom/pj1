### Project Description
"Remember This" is a web application that allows users to send scheduled digital memories (images) to other registered users. These memories become visible only on or after a selected future date, creating a nostalgic surprise experience.

### The Problem Statement
Digital memories shared through chats and social media often get lost over time. There is no simple way to schedule meaningful digital surprises for a future date.

### The Solution
This application allows users to upload an image, select a future date, and choose a recipient. The system securely stores the memory and automatically reveals it to the recipient through a popup notification when the scheduled date arrives.
